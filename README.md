Exploring Time-Series Forecasting with PyCaret

I'm thrilled to share my recent work leveraging PyCaret, a powerful low-code machine learning library that streamlines model selection, training, and evaluation. PyCaret makes it incredibly efficient to compare time series models quickly, enabling data scientists and analysts to optimize the entire process.

Project Overview:

 ðŸ”¹ Developed a Time Series Model using PyCaret in Google Colab
 
 ðŸ”¹ Set the Date column as the index
 
 ðŸ”¹ Converted DataFrameâ€™s datatype for optimal processing
 
 ðŸ”¹ Conducted a comprehensive experiment to create the Time Series Model
 
 ðŸ”¹ Trained and tuned a Random Forest model, achieving 73.8% accuracy
 
 ðŸ”¹ Visualized key insights with charts like CV, PACF, ACF, and Diagnostics
 
 ðŸ”¹ Applied ensemble techniques like blending and stacking for enhanced predictions
 
 ðŸ”¹ Finalized and saved the model for future use

Forecasting Techniques Used: ðŸ”® Applied Theta Forecasting and ARIMA models to predict future trends.

PyCaretâ€™s automated workflow drastically simplified the processâ€”from data preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. Iâ€™m excited to explore how this can be applied to real-world challenges!

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback! Letâ€™s connect and discuss more.
